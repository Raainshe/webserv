WEBSERV EVALUATION ANSWERS
==========================

1. BASICS OF AN HTTP SERVER:
An HTTP server is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and responds with appropriate HTTP responses. It handles:
- TCP socket connections on specific ports
- HTTP request parsing (method, URI, headers, body)
- Static file serving and dynamic content generation
- HTTP response formatting with status codes, headers, and body
- Connection management and multiplexing

2. I/O MULTIPLEXING FUNCTION USED:
The project uses POLL() for I/O multiplexing.
Location: src/networking/event_loop.cpp, line 53-54
Code: int poll_result = poll(&poll_fds[0], poll_fds.size(), 1000);

3. HOW POLL WORKS:
Poll() monitors multiple file descriptors simultaneously for I/O readiness:
- Takes array of pollfd structures containing fd, events, and revents
- Blocks until one or more fds are ready or timeout occurs
- Returns number of ready fds, 0 for timeout, -1 for error
- Sets revents field to indicate which events occurred (POLLIN/POLLOUT/POLLERR/POLLHUP)
- Allows single-threaded server to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently

4. SINGLE POLL USAGE:
✓ YES - There is only one poll() call in the main event loop
Location: src/networking/event_loop.cpp, lines 48-68 in EventLoop::run()

5. POLL CHECKS READ AND WRITE SIMULTANEOUSLY:
✓ YES - The poll checks for both POLLIN and POLLOUT events at the same time
Location: src/networking/event_loop.cpp, lines 89-97 in handle_events()
- POLLIN events handled for server accept and client read
- POLLOUT events handled for client write
- Both checked in same poll call

6. ONE READ/WRITE PER CLIENT PER POLL:
✓ YES - There is only one recv() and one send() call per client per poll iteration
Read path: handle_events() → handle_client_read() → recv() (line 140)
Write path: handle_events() → handle_client_write() → send() (line 316)

7. ERROR HANDLING FOR READ/RECV/WRITE/SEND:
✓ GOOD - All socket operations properly remove clients on error:

recv() error handling (lines 142-146):
- if (bytes_read <= 0) { remove_client(client_fd); return; }

send() error handling (lines 318-322):
- if (bytes_sent < 0) { remove_client(client_fd); return; }

CGI read() error handling (lines 220-223):
- Checks errno and breaks on error

CGI write() error handling (lines 243-252):
- Handles EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK, logs other errors

8. RETURN VALUE CHECKING:
✓ GOOD - Return values are properly checked:
- recv(): checks <= 0 (both error and EOF)
- send(): checks < 0 (error) and partial sends
- read(): checks > 0, == 0 (EOF), < 0 (error)
- write(): checks < 0 (error) and == 0 (no data written)

9. ERRNO CHECKING AFTER SOCKET OPERATIONS:
✓ GOOD - No errno checks after socket operations, only for system calls like poll()
- poll() errno check for EINTR (line 57)
- CGI operations properly check errno for EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK
- Socket operations use return values, not errno

10. FILE DESCRIPTOR OPERATIONS WITHOUT POLL:
✓ GOOD - All file descriptor operations go through poll:
- Server sockets added to poll in setup_poll_fds()
- Client sockets added via add_to_poll() when accepted
- All reads/writes only happen in response to poll events
- No direct file operations bypass poll

11. COMPILATION WITHOUT RE-LINK:
✓ GOOD - Project compiles properly without re-link issues:
- First make: compiles and links successfully
- Second make: "Nothing to be done for 'all'" (no unnecessary rebuilds)
- Makefile has proper dependency tracking
- Uses -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++17 flags
