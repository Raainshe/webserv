# Event Loop Implementation - Step 4

## Overview
Successfully implemented step 4 of the webserv workflow: **Event Loop (poll/select/epoll/kqueue)**. The implementation uses `poll()` as specified in the subject requirements and provides a robust, non-blocking I/O system.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ClientConnection Class
**File:** `includes/networking/client_connection.hpp` and `src/networking/client_connection.cpp`

**Features:**
- Tracks client connection state (READING, WRITING, CLOSING)
- Manages connection timeouts
- Buffers data for each client
- Links clients to their originating server socket
- Automatic cleanup on destruction

**Key Methods:**
- `is_timed_out(time_t timeout_seconds)` - Checks if connection has timed out
- `update_activity()` - Updates last activity timestamp
- `append_to_buffer()` - Adds data to client's buffer
- `close_connection()` - Safely closes the connection

### 2. EventLoop Class
**File:** `includes/networking/event_loop.hpp` and `src/networking/event_loop.cpp`

**Features:**
- Single `poll()` call for all I/O operations (server and client sockets)
- Non-blocking I/O compliance with subject requirements
- Automatic timeout cleanup for idle connections
- Maximum client limit (1000 clients)
- Graceful error handling and connection cleanup

**Key Methods:**
- `run()` - Main event loop
- `handle_new_connection()` - Accepts new client connections
- `handle_client_read()` - Processes incoming data
- `handle_client_write()` - Sends data to clients
- `cleanup_timed_out_clients()` - Removes idle connections

## Compliance with Subject Requirements

### ✅ Non-blocking I/O
- All sockets are set to non-blocking mode
- All read/write operations go through `poll()`
- No direct `read()`/`write()` calls without `poll()`

### ✅ Single poll() for All I/O
- One `poll()` call handles both server and client sockets
- Checks both read and write events simultaneously
- Efficient event handling with proper event filtering

### ✅ No errno Checking After I/O
- Strictly follows subject requirement
- No `errno` checks after read/write operations
- Proper error handling through `poll()` return values

### ✅ Connection Management
- Proper client connection tracking
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
- Timeout handling for idle connections
- Maximum client limit enforcement

### ✅ Signal Handling
- Graceful shutdown with SIGINT
- Proper cleanup on exit

## Testing Results

The implementation has been tested and verified to work correctly:

1. **Basic Connection Test** ✅
   - Server accepts connections on port 8080
   - Echoes back received data (placeholder for HTTP handling)

2. **Multiple Connections Test** ✅
   - Handles multiple simultaneous connections
   - Proper connection tracking and cleanup

3. **Server Stability Test** ✅
   - Server remains stable under load
   - No crashes or memory leaks

4. **Timeout Handling** ✅
   - Idle connections are properly cleaned up
   - Configurable timeout (default 60 seconds)

## Integration with Existing Code

The event loop integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase:

- **SocketManager** - Provides server socket management
- **Configuration Parsing** - Uses parsed server configurations
- **Main Program** - Clean integration with signal handling

## Next Steps

The event loop is ready for the next phase of development:

1. **Step 5: HTTP Request Parsing** - Replace echo functionality with proper HTTP parsing
2. **Step 6: HTTP Response Handling** - Implement proper HTTP responses
3. **Step 7: Routing and Methods** - Add route matching and method handling
